# readme-generator

A comman line program that dynamically generates a clean, formatted README.md based on user-specified inputs

## Usage

This program was built using Node.js.

Please install all dependencies prior to running the program.

When the user runs the application, they must enter their project's title, description, installation instructions, relevant usage information, contribution guidance, and contact information.

The program than writes the user's inputs in a .md file. The README will feature a title, followed by a license badge for their project, as well as a brief description. The program then creates a linked table of contents, allowing the user to click a link to further down in the document. The remainder of the README formats all of the remaining sections using a standardized, clean format.
